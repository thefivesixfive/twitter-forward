# Twitter Forwarding Bot
###### Post to your Twitter, straight from Discord!

The `.env` file must be place in the same directory as the Python file
and needs five variables:
`DISCORD_TOKEN` Your Discord bot token
`TWITTER_API_KEY` Your Twitter API key
`TWITTER_API_SECRET` Your Twitter API secret
`TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN` Your Twitter Access Token
`TWITTER_ACCESS_SECRET` Your Twitter Access Secret

All of these require a Twitter Developer account and a Discord developer
account. Do not use Twitter Projects, create a standalone app.

There is no security on the bot, so it is best used in a private server
with solely you and the bot, or a DM conversation with the bot.
